# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

This is the code repository for the course that I plan to publish as an open source tool to help developers be more effective, especially in a remote setting.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev

### or

yarn dev

### or

pnpm dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
